# Infrastructure as a Service(Iaas)
-  Maximum amount of control for your cloud resources
-  Cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the  physical infrastructure and its access to the internet along with  physical security
-  You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on.

  ## Some common scenarios where IaaS might make sense include:

1. Lift-and-shift migration: You’re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
2. Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control


# Platform as a service (PaaS)  
- Cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet.
  They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.
- It provides a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.

   ## Some common scenarios where PaaS might make sense include:

1. Development framework: PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
2. Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.

# Software as a Service(SaaS)
- Renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.
- Least flexible, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ
- Most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user.

   ## Some common scenarios where SaaS might make sense include:

1. Email and messaging.
2. Business productivity applications.
3. Finance and expense tracking.
