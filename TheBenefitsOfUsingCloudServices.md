# Reliability and predictability in the cloud

## Reliability

Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

## Predictability

Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. 

1. Performance
Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.

2. Cost
Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend.  You can even use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

# Security and governance in the cloud

Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements.
Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies.

On the security side, you can find a cloud solution that matches your security needs. If you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance. 

# Manageability in the cloud

There are  two types of manageability for cloud computing:

1. Management of the cloud
   
Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

* Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
* Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
* Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
* Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.


2. Management in the cloud

Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

Through a web portal.
* Using a command line interface.
* Using APIs.
* Using PowerShell.
